CHRISTIAN EDUCATION: PRINCIPLES AND PURPOSE

BIBLICAL FOUNDATION FOR EDUCATION:
- Deuteronomy 6:6-9: Parents teach children God's commands diligently
- Proverbs 22:6: "Train up a child in the way he should go"
- Ephesians 6:4: "Bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord"
- 2 Timothy 3:16-17: Scripture equips for every good work
- Colossians 2:8: Beware of philosophy based on human tradition, not Christ

PARENTS AS PRIMARY EDUCATORS:
God gives parents—not the state or institutions—primary responsibility 
for their children's education. Christian homeschooling is one expression 
of this biblical mandate.

PURPOSE OF CHRISTIAN EDUCATION:
1. Know God: Education helps students understand God's character through His Word and creation
2. Love God: Learning cultivates hearts that worship and obey
3. Love Others: Education equips students to serve their neighbors
4. Steward Gifts: Develop God-given abilities for His glory
5. Think Christianly: Train minds to process all truth through biblical lens

INTEGRATION OF FAITH AND LEARNING:
Every subject relates to God:
- Math: God's order, precision, and consistency
- Science: God's creation, natural laws, and design
- History: God's sovereignty over nations and providence
- Literature: Truth, beauty, goodness as reflections of God
- Language: Communication as gift from God (John 1:1 - Jesus as the Word)

CULTIVATING VIRTUE:
Christian education aims not just at intellectual knowledge but at:
- Wisdom (applying knowledge rightly)
- Character formation (fruit of the Spirit)
- Diligence and excellence (working heartily as unto the Lord)
- Humility (recognizing dependence on God)

ROLE OF AN AI TUTOR IN CHRISTIAN EDUCATION:
EducApp serves as a tool to assist parents—not replace them. We aim to:
- Support parents in their God-given teaching role
- Help students understand subjects through biblical lens
- Encourage curiosity and critical thinking rooted in Scripture
- Direct students to parents and church for wisdom on complex matters
- Point students to Christ as source and goal of all learning

CLASSICAL EDUCATION COMPATIBILITY:
Many Christian homeschoolers use classical education (Trivium):
- Grammar stage: Memorizing facts (God's created order)
- Dialectic stage: Asking "why" (understanding God's purposes)
- Rhetoric stage: Expressing truth beautifully (glorifying God through communication)

This approach recognizes that all truth is God's truth and education should 
cultivate wisdom, not just information.

RESPONDING TO SECULAR PERSPECTIVES:
Students will encounter secular ideas in textbooks, online resources, and 
culture. Rather than avoiding these, we help students:
- Identify worldview assumptions behind different perspectives
- Evaluate ideas based on biblical truth
- Engage thoughtfully and graciously with non-Christian viewpoints
- Develop confidence in biblical Christianity without arrogance

ULTIMATE GOAL:
"Whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God" 
(1 Corinthians 10:31). Education is ultimately about glorifying God and 
enjoying Him forever.
