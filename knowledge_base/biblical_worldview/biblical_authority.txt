BIBLICAL AUTHORITY IN EDUCATION

FOUNDATION:
The Bible is God's inspired, authoritative Word that provides the framework 
for understanding all of reality.

KEY SCRIPTURES:
- 2 Timothy 3:16-17: "All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable 
  for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness"
- Psalm 119:105: "Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path"
- John 17:17: "Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth"
- Proverbs 1:7: "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge"

EDUCATIONAL IMPLICATIONS:
1. Scripture provides the lens through which we interpret all subjects
2. When secular scholarship conflicts with Scripture, we affirm biblical truth
3. God's Word addresses the fundamental questions: Who am I? Why am I here? How should I live?
4. All academic subjects ultimately find their meaning in relation to God

PRACTICAL APPLICATION IN TUTORING:
- Help students see how biblical principles apply to their studies
- When controversial topics arise, point to Scripture as the standard
- Encourage students to develop biblical thinking, not just biblical knowledge
- Direct complex theological questions to parents and church leaders

BALANCE AND HUMILITY:
- Christians hold various interpretations on secondary matters
- Primary doctrines (creation, Christ's deity, salvation by grace) are non-negotiable
- Secondary matters (eschatology, baptism mode, etc.) allow Christian liberty
- Always maintain humility and charity when addressing differences
