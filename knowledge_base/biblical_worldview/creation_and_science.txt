BIBLICAL WORLDVIEW ON CREATION AND SCIENCE

BIBLICAL FOUNDATION:
- Genesis 1:1: "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth"
- Genesis 1-2: Account of God creating all things
- Genesis 1:27: "'So God created human beings in his own image. In the image of God he created them; male and female he created them."
- Psalm 19:1: "The heavens declare the glory of God"
- Romans 1:20: Creation reveals God's attributes
- Colossians 1:16-17: "By him all things were created... in him all things hold together"

CORE PRINCIPLES:
1. God is the Creator of all things
2. Creation was purposeful and good
3. Humans are uniquely created in God's image
4. The natural world reveals God's character and glory
5. Science is the study of God's creation

APPROACH TO ORIGINS:
The Bible presents God as Creator. Many Christians understand Genesis 1-2 
as describing literal historical events. Others interpret these chapters 
differently while maintaining God as Creator.

Within Christian education, various views exist:
- Young Earth Creationism (recent creation, literal 6 days)
- Old Earth Creationism (ancient earth, various day interpretations)
- Evolutionary Creationism (God used evolutionary processes)

EducApp respects that Christian families hold different perspectives on 
the age of the earth and mechanisms of creation, while all affirm God 
as ultimate Creator.

EVOLUTIONARY THEORY:
Secular science typically teaches macro-evolution (common descent from 
single ancestor). This conflicts with many Christians' understanding of 
Genesis, particularly regarding:
- Direct creation of Adam and Eve
- The entrance of death through sin (not before it)
- Humans as uniquely image-bearers, not evolved animals

EDUCATIONAL APPROACH:
- Present the biblical account as authoritative revelation from God
- Acknowledge that secular education teaches different theories
- Help students understand difference between:
  * Observational science (repeatable experiments)
  * Historical science (interpretation of past events)
- Encourage critical thinking: "What are this theory's assumptions?"
- Direct students to discuss with parents how their family interprets Genesis

SCIENCE AS AWE:
When Christians study science, they explore God's creation. Scientific 
discoveries can inspire awe and wonder at God's wisdom, power, beauty, and 
creativity. Natural laws reflect God's faithfulness and consistency.

RESPONSE TO SPECIFIC QUESTIONS:
If student asks: "Is evolution true?"
→ "Many scientists believe in evolutionary theory, but as Christians, we 
understand that God is the Creator of all life. Different Christian denominations interpret 
Genesis differently regarding how God created. What has your family taught 
you about creation? This is an important topic to discuss with your parents."

If student asks: "How old is the earth?"
→ "Christian scholars who study Scripture carefully have different views on this. 
Some believe the earth is thousands of years old, others believe it's billions 
of years old, but all agree God created it. What matters most is recognizing 
God as Creator. Talk with your parents about your family's understanding."
